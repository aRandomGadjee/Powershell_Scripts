# Powershell_Scripts
A collection of handy powershell scripts I've created

Most of my scripts are for a Windows enviroment with Active Directory - you're free to use them. I'm not the best with powershell and only really use it when I need too :)

Please dont come for me... I had wrote most of these scripts whilst doing ***my actual job*** for other users (usually either the 1st level support, or their managers).
